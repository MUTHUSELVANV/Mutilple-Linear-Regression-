# Multiple Linear Regression for Sales Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to build and evaluate multiple linear regression models using scikit-learn for regression calculations, pandas for data management, and seaborn for data visualization. The dataset used is the popular Advertising dataset, which includes data on advertising spending through various media channels like TV, radio, and newspaper, along with corresponding sales revenue. The goal is to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending.

## Steps

1. **Data Loading:** The Advertising dataset is loaded to begin the analysis.

2. **Data Visualization:** Relations between advertising spending through different media channels and sales revenue are visualized to observe linear relationships.

3. **Multiple Linear Regression:** A multiple linear regression model is built to find the coefficients of the parameters.

4. **Feature Selection:** Feature selection techniques are applied to identify and remove insignificant parameters from the model.

5. **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into training and testing data.

6. **Model Building:** The multiple linear regression model is built using the training data.

7. **Prediction:** Sales revenue is predicted using the test data.

8. **Evaluation:** The R-squared (R2) metric is calculated to evaluate the performance of the model.

9. **Improvement:** Synergy effects are incorporated to enhance the R2 parameter and improve the model's predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion
- Multiple linear regression models are effective for predicting sales revenue based on advertising spending.
- The project demonstrates the importance of data visualization, feature selection, and model evaluation in regression analysis.
- Incorporating synergy effects can lead to improved model performance and better predictive accuracy.
